# Project History

## 2025-07-20 10:58 - Major Ruleset Enhancement: World-Class Research & Planning Discipline

### üéØ **What Was Done**
- Enhanced PROJECT_ONBOARDING_MODE with iterative research and validation loop
- Added COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_MODE for multi-domain intelligence gathering
- Enhanced CODE_REVIEWER_MODE with dual operating modes (code review + research validation)
- Enhanced PLANNER_MODE with task validation loop and alignment verification
- Implemented individual domain research files structure: `docs/research/[domain][topic].md`
- Added comprehensive research documentation: `docs/research/ONBOARDING_COMPREHENSIVE.md`

### üîó **PRD Alignment**
- Fulfills requirement for robust, self-improving ruleset that enforces high-quality engineering standards
- Addresses need for comprehensive onboarding with research-driven documentation
- Supports structured task management with validation gates
- Enables AI-driven complexity estimation and task breakdown

### üíª **Key Enhancements Implemented**

#### **Enhanced PROJECT_ONBOARDING_MODE**
- **Iterative Research & Validation Loop**: Replaced single research pass with infinite loop of research and validation
- **COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_MODE Integration**: Automatically triggers after each research cycle
- **CODE_REVIEWER_MODE Research Validation**: Brutal honesty assessment of research quality (1-10 rating)
- **Loop Control**: Continues until user explicitly confirms research completeness or max 10 cycles
- **Documentation Validation Loop**: Added CODE_REVIEWER_MODE loop to verify PRD.md, technical.md, architecture.mermaid completeness and clarity

#### **New COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_MODE**
- **Domain Identification**: Identifies 3-5 critical knowledge domains per project
- **Multi-Domain Research**: Executes targeted searches across architecture, tech stack, scaling, security, etc.
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates research depth (1-10) for each domain
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Structured findings in `docs/research/ONBOARDING_COMPREHENSIVE.md`
- **Automatic Validation Trigger**: Immediately triggers CODE_REVIEWER_MODE after research

#### **Enhanced CODE_REVIEWER_MODE**
- **Dual Operating Modes**: Code Review + Research Validation
- **Research Validation Criteria**:
  - Completeness Assessment (1-10)
  - Quality & Authority Evaluation (1-10)
  - Practical Applicability (1-10)
  - Risk & Gap Analysis (1-10)
- **Structured Output**: Quality rating, gap identification, recommendations, decision points
- **Gap Identification**: Generates 2-3 follow-up research questions if needed

#### **Enhanced PLANNER_MODE**
- **CODE_REVIEWER_MODE Task Validation Loop**: Added after generating/updating tasks.md
- **Alignment Verification**: Ensures tasks align with PRD.md, technical.md, and research docs
- **Completeness Check**: Reviews task clarity, acceptance criteria, dependencies, edge cases
- **Sufficiency Validation**: Confirms new engineer could execute from tasks alone
- **Iterative Loop**: Continues until user confirms all tasks are aligned and detailed

#### **Research File Structure**
- **Individual Domain Files**: `docs/research/[domain][topic].md` for each research domain
- **Comprehensive Document**: `docs/research/ONBOARDING_COMPREHENSIVE.md` for consolidated findings
- **Task-Specific Research**: `docs/research/[TASK-ID].md` for individual task research

### üß™ **Quality Gates Implemented**
- **No More Single-Pass Research**: Infinite loop until quality gates are met
- **Brutal Honesty Validation**: CODE_REVIEWER_MODE forces quality assessment
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple domains, multiple perspectives, multiple validation cycles
- **Documentation Quality Gates**: PRD, technical, and architecture docs must pass review
- **Task Alignment Verification**: All tasks must trace back to requirements and research

### üßê **Impact & Benefits**
- **Prevents "Good Enough" Documentation**: Enforces world-class research and planning discipline
- **Reduces Implementation Risk**: Comprehensive research validation prevents blind spots
- **Improves Task Quality**: Task validation loop ensures completeness and clarity
- **Enables Scalable Onboarding**: New projects can be bootstrapped from just the rules file
- **Maintains Quality Standards**: Multiple validation cycles ensure high-quality deliverables

### ü™µ **Technical Details**
- **Files Modified**: NEW_RULES.md (enhanced with all described features)
- **New Modes Added**: COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_MODE
- **Enhanced Modes**: PROJECT_ONBOARDING_MODE, CODE_REVIEWER_MODE, PLANNER_MODE
- **Research Structure**: Individual domain files + comprehensive documentation
- **Validation Loops**: Research validation + task validation + documentation validation

### üìã **Next Steps**
- The enhanced ruleset is now ready for use
- All described enhancements from the summary have been implemented
- System now enforces world-class research and planning discipline
- Ready to bootstrap new projects with comprehensive research-driven onboarding

---
*This enhancement transforms the ruleset from a basic development framework into a comprehensive, research-driven, quality-gated system that prevents common failure modes and ensures high-quality deliverables.*
